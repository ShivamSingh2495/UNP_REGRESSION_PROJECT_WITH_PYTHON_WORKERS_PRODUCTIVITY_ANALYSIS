# UNP_REGRESSION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_WORKERS_PRODUCTIVITY_ANALYSIS

During my project with UNP on Worker Productivity Analysis, I worked with a comprehensive dataset focused on employee performance metrics. Using Python, I conducted an end-to-end data analysis process that included data cleaning, outlier treatment, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns influencing productivity levels. I then built and evaluated multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression to predict productivity outcomes and identify the most impactful features contributing to worker efficiency. This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and model evaluation, as well as deepened my understanding of how analytical insights can drive performance optimization. The project files and codebase are available on GitHub for further exploration and improvement, allowing others to extend the analysis and refine the predictive models.
